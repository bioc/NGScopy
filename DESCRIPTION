Title: NGScopy: Detection of Copy Number Variations in Next Generation Sequencing
    sequencing
Description: NGScopy provides a quantitative caller for detecting copy number
    variations in next generation sequencing (NGS), including whole genome
    sequencing (WGS), whole exome sequencing (WES) and targeted panel
    sequencing (TPS). The caller can be parallelized by chromosomes to use
    multiple processors/cores on one computer.
